# ABET Accreditation Document Generator
When a program from and institution is attempting to become ABET accredited, a
self-study document describing the program must be created. This document describes
every aspect of the program, some examples being the courses offered, instructors
in the program, current and previous students, facilities, and administration.  
To keep a consistent format of the document, and to take advantage of the repetitive
nature of listing and enumerating the content for the sections mentioned above,
this project aims to automate the generation of the self-study document via data
collection through a web application running locally on a server on the
institution's network.

This project is being developed for the ABET Accreditation of 4 programs in the
computing field: Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, Information
Technology, and Secure Computing and Information Assurance. More information on
these programs can be found at [this link](https://www.frostburg.edu/academics/colleges-and-departments/computer-science/)
